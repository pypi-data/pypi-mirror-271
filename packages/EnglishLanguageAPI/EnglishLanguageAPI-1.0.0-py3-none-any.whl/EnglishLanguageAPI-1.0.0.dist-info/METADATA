# Lab-93 Dictionary API & Linguistic Analysis Tools
This package offers a simple command-line command for scraping the definition of a word from `dictionary.com`
and returning it to the user.

It also provides a mechanism for building your own in-house dictionary from a list of over 50,000 words.


## Installation
The module is available on Pip, to install to a virtual environment type:
```
pip install EnglishLanguageAPI
```


### Single-Case Usage
To look up the definition of a single word, use the `--word={$WORD}` flag, where $WORD is the word to search for.
```
EnglishLanguageAPI --word={word}
```


### Dictionary Database Builder
The library also includes a system for building an offline dictionary by automating the process of selecting
random words to look up and then writing the word and its definition to a sqlite3 database file.

- `--database`: Write the definition to as many random words as time allows for.
- `--resume`: Keep track of what words haven't been entered into the database.
- `--disposable-wordlist`: A consumable copy of the 50000-wordlist.txt file, for keeping track
                           of what still needs to be defined.
- `--wordlist`: Filepath to the local hardcopy of the 50000-wordlist.txt file.
