This package aims to analyze time series of dynamical models by looking at their underlying matrix of interaction (i.e. the matrix of Jacobian coefficients).
The package has methods to preprocess and plot time series, infer their time-evolving matrices of Jacobian coefficients, treat those matrices as the adjacency matrix of a signed directed graph, compute the triadic and global balance of the time series, and plot the evolution of balance/frustration in the network.
A detailed user manual has been uploaded to the github repository https://github.com/abadreddine/FrustrationDynamiX/tree/main
