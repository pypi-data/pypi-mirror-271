#MyPackage
MyPackage is a Python package designed to facilitate the privacy-preserving processing of CSV files containing sensitive information. It leverages a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's Transformers to identify and redact personal and sensitive information from specified columns in a CSV file. Additionally, it provides a Gradio interface for users to upload their CSV files, view the modifications, and download the processed file.

#Features
Identifies and redacts sensitive information such as names, emails, phone numbers, and locations.
Processes CSV files to protect personal and sensitive information.
Provides an intuitive Gradio interface for easy file uploads and downloads.
Supports GPU acceleration for efficient data processing.

This command will start a local server and print a URL to access the Gradio interface. From there, you can:

Upload a CSV file you wish to process.
View the modifications made to the CSV file in the output section.
Download the processed CSV file.
Programmatic Use
If you wish to use MyPackage programmatically in your Python scripts, you can import and use the modify_csv function:

python
Copy code
from my_package.utils import modify_csv

# Path to your CSV file
file_path = 'path/to/your/file.csv'

# Process the CSV file
processed_df = modify_csv(file_path)

# Do something with the processed DataFrame, e.g., save it to a new file
processed_df.to_csv('path/to/your/processed_file.csv', index=False)
