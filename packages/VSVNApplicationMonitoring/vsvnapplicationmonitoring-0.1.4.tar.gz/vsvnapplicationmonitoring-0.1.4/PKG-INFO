To integrate application data into the Application Monitoring system, there are 2 functions:

    saveActiveUser: Save user information of the system every time they log in. The data passed includes:
        api_url = "http://localhost:5000"; // the API url of the Application Monitoring system
        data_user = {
            application_code: "app_1", // code of the application registered in the Application Monitoring system. Different applications have different codes
            user_name: "user_1" // username logged into the application
        }
    saveRequestCost: Store the cost information for each request. The data passed includes:
        api_url = "http://localhost:5000"; // the API url of the Application Monitoring system
        data_request = {
        service_code: "app_1", // code of the service registered in the Application Monitoring system. Different services have different codes
        cost: 0.5 // Cost for this request. Unit: dollars
        }
The return result when calling these functions has a statusCode of 200 if the data is stored successfully. Otherwise, please call again.
