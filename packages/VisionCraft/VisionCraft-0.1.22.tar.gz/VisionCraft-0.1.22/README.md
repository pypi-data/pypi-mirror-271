## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prem07a/VisionCraft.git
```


1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
   This command creates a virtual environment named `env`.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment (Optional, Depending on OS):**
   - **On Windows:**
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **On macOS and Linux:**
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
   Activating the virtual environment isolates your Python environment, ensuring that packages are installed only within this environment.

3. **Install Dependencies from requirements.txt:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command installs the Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. These packages are necessary for your project and may include libraries, frameworks, or tools required for running the code.

After following these steps, your virtual environment should be set up, activated, and the project dependencies installed. You can then proceed with running your Python scripts or working on your VisionCraft project within this isolated environment.

## Usage

Import VisionCraft modules into your Python script or Jupyter notebook:

```python
# Example: Importing filter functions
from VisionCraft.vision.filter import boxFilter

# Example: Importing processing functions
