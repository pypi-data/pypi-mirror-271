# Bokeh Joystick Widget

This is a custom widget for the Python Bokeh library that allows you to control a joystick via mouse drags or touch gestures.

The widget has x and y properties that are updated as the joystick is moved. The x and y properties are in the range -100 to 100.

The widget makes use of <https://github.com/bobboteck/JoyStick/>.

## Setup

## Usage

## Examples

There are two examples:

- examples/static_joystick_example.py - show a column with a plot and the joystick, then exit.
- examples/console_joystick_example.py - show a plot and the joystick in a bokeh server app. Callbacks from the front end drive console logs of the joystick position.

## Roadmap

- Get the example JS demo widget/bokeh model to work - whatever that widget is. - done
- Figure out how to get values back to the python end with it. - done
- Figure out how to swap their control for the joystick (however hacky) - done
    - Note - this is a TS file from the original, adapted here. The DOM element change
      is important.
- Figure out how to make that tidier. - done
- Figure out how to publish to PyPi (alpha) and test in a pip installed test.
