Description: This repository contains 3D variants of popular classification CNN models like ResNets, DenseNets, VGG, etc for keras module. It also contains weights obtained by converting ImageNet weights from the same 2D models. Models work with keras 3 with different backends like Tensorflow, Torch and Jax.More details: https://github.com/ZFTurbo/classification_models_3D
