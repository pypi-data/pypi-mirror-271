task_decomposition:
  description: >
    Analyze the high-level task, "{task}", provided and break it down into
    distinct, manageable subtasks that are specific and actionable.
    Consider all aspects of the task and ensure that each subtask is
    aligned with the final goal. Additionally, outline the roles, goals,
    and backstories for the agents you plan to recruit for performing
    each subtask. Make sure to clearly define their responsibilities in
    the context of this project.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed list of subtasks, each with defined objectives and
    scopes, ensuring they collectively address all components of the
    original task, "{task}". Each subtask should be assigned to a
    specific agent you will recruit, complete with their role, goal, and
    backstory. The main goal is to ensure systematic progression and
    effective task management.

resource_allocation:
  description: >
    Evaluate the list of subtasks generated from the high-level task
    "{task}" and determine the most appropriate agents and tools needed
    for each. Assign resources based on the complexity, required skills,
    and the tools needed to effectively complete each subtask. This
    evaluation should consider the unique requirements of each subtask
    and align resources to optimize task completion. Available tools to
    choose from include:
    {tools_list}.
  expected_output: >
    An allocation plan that lists each subtask along with the assigned
    agent and the tools they will use, explaining the rationale for each
    resource assignment to ensure transparency and optimal task
    alignment. The expected outcome is to have a fully resourced plan
    that facilitates efficient task execution and achievement of the
    main goal: "{goal}".
    Ensure each tool selected is from the provided list of available tools:
    {tools_list}.
