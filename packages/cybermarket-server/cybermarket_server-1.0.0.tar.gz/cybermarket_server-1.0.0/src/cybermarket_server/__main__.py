"""
This module provides an asynchronous server for handling client requests.

The server listens on a local port and asynchronously processes requests.
It maintains a connection list and associated message handling queues.

Functions:
    handle_client(reader, writer): Asynchronously handle client connections.
    main(): Start the server and listen for incoming connections.
