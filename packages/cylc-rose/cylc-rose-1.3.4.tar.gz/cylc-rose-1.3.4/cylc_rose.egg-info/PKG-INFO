A [Cylc](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow) plugin providing support for the
[Rose](https://github.com/metomi/rose) `rose-suite.conf` file.

For use with Cylc 8 and Rose 2.

### Installation

Install from PyPi:

```
pip install cylc-rose
```

Or Conda:

```
conda install cylc-rose
```

No further configuration is required, Cylc will load this plugin automatically.

### Overview

In the past Rose provided a wrapper to Cylc providing additional capabilities
including workflow installation.

As of Cylc 8 and Rose 2 some of this functionality has been re-built directly
in Cylc, the rest has been migrated into this Plugin.

The last versions of Cylc and Rose which use the wrapper are:

* Cylc 7
* Rose 2019

For all later versions please install this plugin into your Cylc/Rose
environment for Rose integration.

### What This Plugin Does

This plugin provides support for the `rose-suite.conf` file, namely:

* Jinja2/EmPy template variables.
* Scheduler environment variables.
* File installation.
* Optional configurations.

### What This Plugin Does Not Do

* Support the `root-dir*` configurations, these have been deprecated by
  the new Cylc `symlink dirs` functionality.
* Graphical configuration editors.
