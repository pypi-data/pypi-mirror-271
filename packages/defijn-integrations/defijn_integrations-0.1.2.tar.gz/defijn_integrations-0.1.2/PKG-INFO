To build and publish `defijn-integrations` to PyPI, follow these steps using Poetry:

### Building the Package

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.

    This command will generate the distribution package in the `dist` directory.

### Publishing the Package

1. Setting up Authentication for PyPI

   Before you can publish packages to PyPI, you need to authenticate your package upload requests. You can do this by creating a .pypirc file in your home directory with the following content:
    
   ```ini
   [distutils]
   index-servers =
     pypi
   
   [pypi]
   repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
   username = __token__
   password = <your-token>
   ```
    
   Replace `<your-token>` with your PyPI token.

2. Run the following command to publish your package:

   ```bash
    twine upload dist/*
   ```

    This command will publish your package to PyPI.
