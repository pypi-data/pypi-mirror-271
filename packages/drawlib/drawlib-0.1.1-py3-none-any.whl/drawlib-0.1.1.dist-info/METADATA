# drawlib

## About

drawlib is a Python drawing library designed to achieve *Illustration as Code*.

In today's world, many technical documents are managed using version control systems such as Git. 
However, managing illustrations poses a challenge as they are typically binary files rather than text-based. drawlib offers a solution by generating illustrations from pure Python code. 
This means that if you create your illustrations using Python and drawlib, you can manage them using version control systems too.

drawlib is optimized for drawing a large number of illustrations with a consistent style.
You can easily achieve this by creating a theme file (which is simply a Python code) and importing it into your illustration codes (also Python code).
Additionally, you can leverage the Python ecosystem, including:
- accessing library help and code completion via IDEs,
- using programming constructs such as creating functions for grouping drawing tasks and using loops.

We have provided examples of building Sphinx-based documentation with numerous drawlib images. If you're interested, please give it a try.

Enjoy!
