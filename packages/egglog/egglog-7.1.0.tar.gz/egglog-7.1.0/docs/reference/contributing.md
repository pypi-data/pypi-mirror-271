# Contributing

This package is in active development and we welcome contributions.

## Documentation

We use the [Di√°taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) to organize our documentation. The "explanation" section has
been renamed to "Blog" since most of the content there is more like a blog post than a reference manual. It uses
the [ABlog](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#how-it-works) extension.

## Governance

The governance is currently informal, with Saul Shanabrook as the lead maintainer. If the project grows and there
are more contributors, we will formalize the governance structure in a way to allow it to be multi-stakeholder and
to spread out the power and responsibility.
