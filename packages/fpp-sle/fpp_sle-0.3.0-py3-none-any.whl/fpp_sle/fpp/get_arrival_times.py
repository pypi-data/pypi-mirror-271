"""Create arrival times from rate processes.

The rate process is understood as a varying intermittency parameter used within the FPP
framework.

All functions in this module (starting with `from_`) should be decorated with `pass_rate`
when used with the `VariableRateForcing` class. They also take in the same set of
parameters:
    rate: np.ndarray
        The rate process to convert.
    times: np.ndarray
        The time axis.
    total_pulses: int
        The total number of pulses.
