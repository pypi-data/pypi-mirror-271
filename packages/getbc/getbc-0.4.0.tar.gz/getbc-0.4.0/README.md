# **getbc**


## **What the program does**
This program's primary responsibilty is to make installing bomcheckgui
to a person's local computer easy.  It creates a virtual environment
for bomcheckgui and installs bomcheckgui and its dependencies there,
and creates a desktop link to bomcheckgui.  It can also check for
program upgrades and can uninstall bomcheckgui.  Note: this program
only works on Microsoft Windows, and only works with a standard python
installation as compared to a variation of python like the Anaconda
python distribution.

## **How to install**
Assuming that you already have Python on your machine, use the package
manager software [pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager))
that comes with Python and run this from a command line:

`pip install getbc`

Once installed, run getbc from a cmd module.  When you run it, it will
give instruction on how to proceed.
