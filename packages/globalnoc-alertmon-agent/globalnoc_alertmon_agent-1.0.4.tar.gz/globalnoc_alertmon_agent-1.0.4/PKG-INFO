## process_events.py

In this example an http server is started to listen for events POST'd to it. On a regular interval those POST'd events are combined with the current set of active alerts.

* If an **OK** alerts is POST'd the corresponding active alert is cleared.
* To handle cases where a clear event may have been missed, alerts exceeding some time threshold are also cleared.

Then the full set of alerts are sent to the system.
