    hint: >-
      Creates a virtual `Handheld Daemon Controller` that can be used normally
      in apps. Back buttons are supported but steam will not detect them.
      If Gyroscope or Accelerometer are enabled, a Motion device will be
      created as well (experimental; works in Dolphin).

    title: Dualsense
    hint: >-
      Emulates the Dualsense Sony controller from the Playstation 5.
      Since this controller does not have paddles, the paddles are mapped
      to left and right touchpad clicks.

    children:
      led_support:
        type: bool
        title: LED Support
        hint: >-
          Passes through the LEDs to the controller, which allows games
          to control them.
        default: True

      paddles_to_clicks:
        type: bool
        title: Paddles to Clicks
        hint: >-
          Maps the paddles of the device to left and right touchpad clicks
          making them usable in Steam.
          If more than 2 paddles (e.g., Legion Go) uses the top ones.
          If extra buttons (e.g., Ayaneo, GPD), uses them instead.
        default: True

      sync_gyro:
        type: bool
        title: Gyro Output Sync
        hint: >-
          Steam relies on the IMU timestamp for the touchpad as Mouse and `Gyro to Mouse [BETA]`.
          If the same timestamp is sent in 2 reports, this causes a division by 0 and instability.
          This option makes it so reports are sent only when there is a new
          IMU timestamp, effectively limiting the responsiveness of the
          controller to that of the IMU.
          This only makes a difference for the Legion Go (125hz), as all the other
          handhelds are using 400hz by default.
        default: True

      flip_z:
        type: bool
        title: Invert Roll Axis
        default: True
        hint: >-
          Inverts the roll (Z) axis compared to a real Dualsense controller.
          Useful for Steam Input, since you want it to be inverted to look
          left to right, but an issue in emulators.

      bluetooth_mode:
        type: bool
        title: Bluetooth Mode
        tags: [advanced, expert]
        hint: >-
          Emulates the controller in bluetooth mode instead of USB mode.
          This is the default as it causes less issues with how apps
          interact with the controller.
          However, using USB mode can improve LED support (?) in some games.
          Test and report back!
        default: True

  dualsense_edge:
    type: container
    tags: [lgc_emulation_dualsense_edge, dualsense_edge, non-essential]
    title: Dualsense Edge
    hint: >-
      Emulates the expensive Dualsense Sony controller which enables paddle support.
      The edge controller is a bit obscure, so some games might not
      support it correctly.
