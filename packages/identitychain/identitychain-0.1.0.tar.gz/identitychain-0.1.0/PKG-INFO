              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# IdentityChain

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/identitychain?color=blue&label=PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/identitychain/) [![CI](https://github.com/marcusm117/IdentityChain/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/marcusm117/IdentityChain/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-green)](https://github.com/marcusm117/IdentityChain/blob/main/LICENSE) [![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/marcusm117/IdentityChain?color=red&label=Issues)](https://github.com/marcusm117/IdentityChain/issues)

The IdentityChain Framework for Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) Evaluation. Official implementation of the ICLR 2024 paper [Beyond Accuracy: Evaluating Self-Consistency of Code Large Language Models with IdentityChain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14053).

The IdentityChain Framework evaluates the NL-to-PL (Code Generation) Accuracy, PL-to-NL (Code Summurization) Accuracy, and the Self-Consistency across the two tasks. It also provides a fine-grained analysis of the model's performance so that you can pinpoint the exact step and problem where the model makes a self-inconsistency violation.

## Installation

Create and Activate a Conda Environment.

   ``` bash
   conda create -n idchain python=3.10
   conda activate idchain
   ```

Install from PyPI with all Dependencies.

   ``` bash
   pip3 install identitychain
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Install from Source with all Dependencies.

   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/marcusm117/IdentityChain.git
   cd IdentityChain
   make develop
   ```

## Usage

Before the self-consistency evaluation, you need to make sure that one of the followings is satisfied:

1. Your model is an Instruction-tuned Code LLM, and it's trained on both NL-to-PL and PL-to-NL tasks.
2. Your model is a Foundation Code LLM, and it's trained on both completion and fill-in-the-middle tasks.

To evaluate your model using IdentityChain, you need to prepare the followings:

1. An evaluation dataset from one of the followings (or one of your own in the same format):
   - [EvalPlus-Mini-v0.1.6_reformatted.jsonl](./data/EvalPlus-Mini-v0.1.6_reformatted.jsonl.gz)
   - [EvalPlus-Mini-v0.1.10_reformatted.jsonl](./data/EvalPlus-Mini-v0.1.10_reformatted.jsonl.gz)
   - [MBPP-S_test_reformatted.jsonl](./data/MBPP-S_test_reformatted.jsonl.gz)
2. An NL-to-PL prompt for your model
3. A PL-to-NL prompt for your model
4. An NL-to-PL generation function for your model
5. A PL-to-NL generation function for your model

See [run_identity_chain_openai.py](./examples/run_identity_chain_openai.py) for an example of how to use IdentityChain to evaluate OpenAI models.

See [run_identity_chain_google.py](./examples/run_identity_chain_google.py) for an example of how to use IdentityChain to evaluate Google models.

See [run_identity_chain_huggingface.py](./examples/run_identity_chain_huggingface.py) for an example of how to use IdentityChain to evaluate HuggingFace open-source models. This example script already includes the following models:

1. CodeLlama-Instruct-hf (7B, 13B, 34B, 70B)
2. CodeLlama-hf (7B, 13B, 34B, 70B)
3. StarChat-Beta
4. StarCoder
5. StarCoderPlus
6. StarCoderBase (1B, 3B, 7B, 15B)
7. DeepSeekCoder-Instruct (1.3B, 6.7B, 33B, 7B-v1.5)
8. DeepSeekCoder (1.3B, 6.7B, 33B, 7B-v1.5)

## Example

Use [run_identity_chain.sh](./examples/run_identity_chain.sh) to execute scripts [run_identity_chain_openai.py](./examples/run_identity_chain_openai.py) or [run_identity_chain_huggingface.py](./examples/run_identity_chain_huggingface.py), which conducts several IdentityChain evaluation in a batch. Make sure that you modify the followings before running the script:

1. `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` to specify the local GPU device you want to use
2. `export HF_HOME=YOUR_OWN_PATH/huggingface` to specify your own huggingface home path, where the model checkpoints will be cached
3. `export IDENTITY_CHAIN_HOME=YOUR_OWN_PATH/IdentityChain` to your own IdentityChain home path
4. other parameters in the script for your own needs

Then run the script:

``` bash
cd examples
bash run_identity_chain.sh
```

This script will create a temporary folder `tmp` under your IdentityChain home path, and store the results of IdentityChain evaluation in this folder, which will be a `jsonl` file. For example, `tmp/starcoderbase-1b/IDChain_starcoderbase-1b_tmp0.0g_len5_pb_all_m_v1_EvalPlus-Mini-v0.1.6_reformatted.jsonl`.

Use [analyze_results.py](./scripts/analyze_results.py) to analyze the results of IdentityChain evaluation. It will geneartes an `xlsx` file, which contains the following information:

1. The SC (Self-Consistency) and SSC (Strong Self-Consistency) scores of the model at each self-iteration step. Note that SSC_0 is just Pass@1
2. The aggregated TOM score (also BLEU and CodeBLEU) information at each step for the following 4 types of resulsts: Pass-Pass, Pass-Fail, Fail-Fail, Fail-Pass
3. The TOM score (also BLEU and CodeBLEU) trajectory at each self-iteration step for each sample in the eavluation set.
4. The raw test case outputs at each self-iteration step

``` bash
cd ../scripts
python analyze_results.py --input_path ../tmp/starcoderbase-1b/IDChain_starcoderbase-1b_tmp0.0g_len5_pb_all_m_v1_EvalPlus-Mini-v0.1.6_reformatted.jsonl --chain_length 5
```

The analyzed results will give you a sense of the model's overall performance, and the TOM score trajectory will help you pinpoint the exact step where the model makes a mistake.

Use [browse_results.py](./scripts/browse_results.py) to browse the results of IdentityChain evaluation. You can use this script to manually examine and study the mistakes made by the model for specific samples.

``` bash
cd ../scripts
python browse_results.py --input_path ../tmp/starcoderbase-1b/IDChain_starcoderbase-1b_tmp0.0g_len5_pb_all_m_v1_EvalPlus-Mini-v0.1.6_reformatted.jsonl --chain_length 5 --start 0
```

## Linting & Testing

We use a `Makefile` as a command registry:

- `make format`: autoformat  this library with `black`
- `make lint`: perform static analysis of this library with `black` and `flake8`
- `make annotate`: run type checking using `mypy`
- `make test`: run automated tests
- `make check`: check assets for packaging

Make sure that `make lint`, `make test`, and `make check` all pass locally before submitting a Pull Request.
