ITDE is a Python-based tool designed to extract valuable information, including multimedia content and associated metadata, from the data provided by InnerTube, Google's private API. 
InnerTube serves as a comprehensive source of data, and ITDE empowers developers to seamlessly retrieve and organize essential details from this platform.

### Features

- **Organized Data Structures:**  ITDE organizes extracted data in a structured and typed manner.
- **Versatility:** Designed to handle various types of multimedia content.
- **Python Compatibility:** Written in Python, making it accessible and easy to integrate into existing projects.

### Installation
```shell
pip install itde
```

### Usage
```python
from innertube import InnerTube           # Python Client for Google's Private InnerTube API
from itde import extractor                # Module for extraction

client = InnerTube('WEB_REMIX')           # Construct a client
data = client.search('Squarepusher')      # Get data
extracted_data = extractor.extract(data)  # Extract data.

for shelf in extracted_data.contents:
    print("Shelf")
    print(" ", shelf.name)
    print(" ", shelf.endpoint)
    print(" ", shelf.continuation)
    print(" ", shelf.type)
    
    for item in shelf:
        print("  Item")
        print("  ", item.type)
        print("  ", item.endpoint)
        print("  ", item.name)
        print("  ", item.thumbnail_url)
        print("  ", item.description)  
```
