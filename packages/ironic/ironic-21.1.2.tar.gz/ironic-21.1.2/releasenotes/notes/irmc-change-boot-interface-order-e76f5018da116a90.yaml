    Fixes the default boot interface order for the ``irmc`` hardware type
    where previously it would prefer ``irmc-pxe`` over ``ipxe``. This
    created inconsistencies for operators using multiple hardware types,
    where both interfaces were enabled in the deployment.
    Because the fix is backported on this point of releasae of Zed,
    operators who will update their environment beyond this release have
    to check the related upgrade note and take necessary action even
    though their update will be done in Zed release.
upgrade:
  - |
    ``ipxe`` boot_interface will be preferred to ``irmc-pxe`` by default
    with the ``irmc`` hardware type during the new baremetal node
    creation. This change doesn't affect to the existing baremetal nodes.
    Operators who want to continue to use ``irmc-pxe`` as default boot
    interface need to specify it in ``[DEFAULT]default_boot_interface``
    setting in ``ironic.conf``.
