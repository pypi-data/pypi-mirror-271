=====

l4v1 is a Python library designed to simplify some data-analytics tasks using data manipulation 
and visualization techniques. Built on top of Polars and Plotly, it offers a straightforward API 
for creating detailed summaries in a quick way.

It is work in progress and more functionality is to be added in future.
