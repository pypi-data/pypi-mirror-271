## Installation

``` shell
pip install llm-vertex

```

Export two environment variables for the GCP Project and location you want to use:

``` shell
export VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=gcp-project-id VERTEX_LOCATION=us-east1
```

Run llm and specify one of the provided models:

``` shell
‚ùØ llm -m gemini-1.5-pro-preview-0409 "What's one clever name for a pet pelican?"
