    Date:    17-11-2023
    Version: 1.1.0

    Added GetType function to determine the type of a variable or value.

    Date:    23-11-2023
    Version: 1.1.1

    Removed GetType function. The language has a built in type to replace it.

    Date: 2024-04-07
    Version: 5.5.0.alpha.1

    Added constant with version information about the library.
    In principle all libraries are required to have this, but the interpreter will generate one if there isn't one already.
    The interpreter will also add the path to this library file to the constant regardless if this constant exists in the 
    library or not.

    Date 2024-04-10
    Version: 5.5.0.beta.1

    Added GetEnv as alias for Env, it's a more given as we also have SetEnv.
    Also added LoadEnv to make use of the dotenv library's capability to load system variables from a .env file.
    Path to the file is an optional argument.
