Data structures and naming conventions
======================================
This list only includes data types that don't have their own classes.

`img`:
  A `np.ndarray` that contains the voxelized scene.

`atoms`:
  A `pandas.DataFrame` with the following columns: x, y, z, element.  This is 
  the way atoms are expected to be represented externally.  Internally, the 
  Atom data class is used to represent individual atoms.

`voxel`:
  A 3D `numpy.ndarray` containing the index for one of the cells in the image.  
  Generally, these indices are constrained to actually fall within the image in 
  question (i.e. no indices greater than the size of the image or less than 0).  
  Note that a `grid` object is needed to determine the physical location of the 
  voxel.  When multiple voxels are involved, the array has dimensions of (N,3).

`coords`:
  A 3D `numpy.ndarray` containing the location of the center of a voxel in 
  real-world coordinates, in units of Angstroms.  When multiple coordinates 
  that involved, the array has dimensions of (N,3).

            A dataframe representing the atoms to voxelize.  This function 
            requires a column named "element", which must contain element names 
            as strings.

        channels:
            A list of regular expression patterns, each of which should match 
            elements that belong in a particular channel.  The *first_match* 
            argument controls what happens if multiple patterns match the same 
            atom.

            For example, ``['C', 'N', 'O', '.*']`` would place carbon in the 
            first channel, nitrogen in the second channel, and oxygen in the 
            third channel.  The fourth channel would contain all atoms 
            (including those already in one of the first three channels) if 
            *first_match=False*, otherwise it contain just those atoms that 
            aren't in of the earlier channels.

        first_match:
            If *True*, only allow each atom to occupy one channel: the first 
            one it matches.  If *False*, each atom will occupy every channel it 
            matches.

        allow_missing_atoms:
            If *True*, atoms that aren't assigned to any channel will be 
            silently removed.  By default, an error will be raised if any such 
            atoms are present.

    Returns:
        The input dataframe, with a *channels* column added.  Each entry in 
        this column will be a list of integers, where each integer identifies a 
        single channel and will be in the range [0, ``len(channels) - 1``].

    #
    # - Coordinates and voxel indices are represented as row vectors by 
    #   python/numpy, and as column vectors by C++/Eigen.  This means that 
    #   arrays have to be transposed when moving from one language to the 
    #   other.  In principle, it would be possible to use the same row/column 
    #   vector convention in both languages.  But this would make it harder to 
    #   interact with third-party libraries like `overlap`.
    #
    # - Eigen doesn't have 1D arrays.  Instead it has vectors, which are just 
    #   2D matrices with either 1 row or 1 column.  When converting a vector 
    #   from C++/Eigen back to python/numpy, it's not clear whether the 
    #   resulting array should be 1D or 2D.  This ambiguity can be resolved by 
    #   looking at the shape of the original numpy input.
    #
    # I decided against accounting for either of these issues in the binding 
    # code itself.  The main reason for exposing most of the C++ functions to 
    # python is testing, and for that it's not helpful to be changing the 
    # inputs and outputs.  But this specific function is useful in other 
    # contexts, so I wrote this wrapper function to enforce the python 
    # conventions.
