ManiSkill is a powerful unified framework for robot simulation and training powered by [SAPIEN](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/). The entire stack is as open-source as possible. Among its features, it includes
- GPU parallelized visual data collection system. A policy can collect RGBD + Segmentation data at about 10,000+ FPS with 1 GPU, 10-100x faster than any other simulator
- Example tasks covering a wide range of different robot embodiments (quadruped, mobile manipulators, single-arm robots) as well as a wide range of different tasks (table-top, locomotion, scene-level manipulation)
- GPU parallelized tasks, enabling incredibly fast synthetic data collection in simulation at the same or faster speed as other GPU sims like IsaacSim
- GPU parallelized tasks support simulating diverse scenes where every parallel environment has a completely different scene/set of objects
- Flexible task building API
