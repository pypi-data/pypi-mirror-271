# ManyHTTPS

**ManyHTTPS** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library for sending multiple asyncronous requests, built on the classic requests library.

```python
>>> import manyhttps
>>> r = manyhttps.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'), amount=100)
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
>>> r.encoding
'utf-8'
>>> r.text
'{"authenticated": true, ...'
>>> r.json()
{'authenticated': True, ...}
```

ManyHTTPS allows you to send thousands of HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data — but nowadays, just use the `json` method!

## Cloning the repository

When cloning the Requests repository, you may need to add the `-c
fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore` flag to avoid an error about a bad commit (see
[this issue](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/2690) for more background):

```shell
git clone -c fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore https://github.com/psf/requests.git
```

You can also apply this setting to your global Git config:

```shell
git config --global fetch.fsck.badTimezone ignore
```
