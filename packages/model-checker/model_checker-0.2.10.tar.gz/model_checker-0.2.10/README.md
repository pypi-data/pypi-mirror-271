# Model Checker

This project aims to develop tools for proving theorems and finding countermodels for counterfactual conditional and modal claims.

## Installation

Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run the following commands in the terminal:

```
pip install z3-solver
pip install model-checker
```

## Examples

To generate a test file run `model-checker`.
Alternatively, run `model-checker path/to/test_file.py` if `test_file.py` already exists.
The `examples.py` file contains a number of valid and invalid arguments that can be tested.
