# Mutation profile

This repository comprises the script(s) developed during Monkeypox 2022 outbreak to explore the mutational profiles/signatures of this virus, but that can be of broad application to other species. Currently, it comprises the script(s):
- _get_mutation_profile.py_ that can be used to rapidly obtain the sequence context (size defined by the user) flanking SNPs of interest and determine their mutational profile according to the user's specifications (e.g. APOBEC3-mediated viral genome editing GA>AA and TC>TT replacements)

## Input/Output of _get_mutation_profile.py_
									
**OPTION1**   
_Inputs:_    
1. TSV file with the columns POS REF ALT (i.e. 1-indexed reference position, reference allele and alternative allele)
2. Fasta file including the reference genome

_Output:_    
1. TSV file with the mutation context and profile

**OPTION 2**     
_Inputs:_   
1. TSV file with the columns ID POS REF ALT (i.e. sample ID, 1-indexed reference position, reference allele and alternative allele)
2. Fasta file including the reference genome

_Outputs:_    
1. TSV file with the mutation context and profile for each sample present in the TSV input
2. TSV file with a summary report for each position of interest including the different patterns observed and their respective frequency

_NOTE: For options 1 and 2 the order of the columns in the input 1 is not important but their name is (ID, POS, REF, ALT)!!_

**OPTION 3**  
_Inputs:_    
1. Single-column file with a list of 1-indexed reference positions of interest   
2. Multiple Sequence Alignment (fasta) including the reference genome    
									
_Outputs:_     
1. TSV file with the mutation context and profile for each sample present in the alignment
2. TSV file with a summary report for each position of interest including the different patterns observed and their respective frequency

_TIP: If you do not know your positions of interest, you can run the script _alignment_processing.py_ of [ReporTree](https://github.com/insapathogenomics/ReporTree) and it will provide a list of positions of interest according to your specifications._

                        per position, add also the column 'ID' (note that the
                        order of the columns is not important but their name
                        is!)
  -r REF, --reference REF

                        of interest (upper-case!). Default = 'GA>AA,TC>TT'
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        [OPTIONAL] Tag for output file name. Default =
                        Mutation_profile
```

## Examples using Monkeypox 2022 outbreak data available at [_examples/_](https://github.com/insapathogenomics/mutation_profile/tree/main/examples)

### Option 1 (this option reflects part of the analysis performed in the publication)
Providing a TSV file with the columns POS REF ALT (i.e. 1-indexed reference position, reference allele and alternative allele) and a fasta file including the reference genome (can be the same alignment or a normal fasta sequence).

```bash
mutation-profile -f alignment_Figure1B.fasta -m positions_of_interest_POS_REF_ALT.txt -r 'MT903344.1_Monkeypox_virus_isolate_MPXVUK_P2_complete_genome' -b 10 -a 10 -o OPTION1
