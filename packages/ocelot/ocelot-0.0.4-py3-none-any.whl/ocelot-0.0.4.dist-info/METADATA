# ocelot

A toolbox for working with observations of star clusters. 

It's _`ocelot`_ for short - the **O**pen-source star **C**lust**E**r mu**L**ti-purp**O**se **T**oolkit! (Its results are better than this acronym.)

## Installation

For now, the repo should just be installed from GitHub source like this:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/emilyhunt/ocelot
```

## November 2023 update

Previously, this was a private repo containing code I used in my PhD: it's now public!

Over time, I'd like to develop this codebase further. I'd especially really like to involve members of the community and make this a useful toolbox of reliable, fast code for working with star cluster data in the era of Gaia. Message me if there's anything you'd like to add!

I currently expect to get time to start working on properly documenting and publishing this code in 2024; before then, feel free to use whatever you can find =)
