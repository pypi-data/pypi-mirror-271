# organage

A package to estimate organ-specific biological age using aging models trained on SomaScan plasma proteomics data (Oh and Rutledge et al. _Nature_ 2023 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06802-1)  

## System requirements

### Hardware requirements

organage package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations.

- maxOS 11.7.1
- Linux: CentOS 7.x

#### Python dependencies

- python>=3.9 and <=3.10
- dill>=0.3.6
- pandas>=1.5.3
- scikit-learn==1.0.2. aging models were trained using this specific version of scikit-learn

## Installation
