This is based on the Hsiao uberspectra released by
Eric in 2008 .  It includes the Matheson spectra, and
some near IR data from the CSP.  It was then
run through the usual training process.  It is based
on the shifted Landolt filters:
 B 8.485 V 2.667 R 21.609 I 11.283
This uses the French photometry, Oct 9 2009 version
with a BD based calibration.
This includes the Hicken SNe, some SDSS,
and the CSP SNe.

This is conley09e with CSP and SDSS data.

"sed_templatev2.dat" is the same as the "sed_template.dat" 
template, but linearly interpolated to have spectra
every 0.5 days.
This template was previously called 'conley09f'
