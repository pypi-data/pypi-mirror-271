This repository is a binging of Any2Json for Python language.

## Description

In today's data-driven landscape, navigating the complexities of semi-structured documents poses a significant challenge
for organizations. These documents, characterized by diverse formats and a lack of standardization, often require
specialized skills for effective manipulation and analysis. However, we propose a novel framework to address this
challenge. By leveraging innovative algorithms and machine learning techniques, [Any2Json](https://github.com/RomualdRousseau/Any2Json)
offers a solution that gives you control over the data extraction process with tweakable and repeatable settings.
Moreover, by automating the extraction process, it not only saves time but also minimizes errors, particularly beneficial
for industries dealing with large volumes of such documents. Crucially, this framework integrates with machine learning workflows,
unlocking new possibilities for data enrichment and predictive modeling. By leveraging determinist algorithms, this framework is perfect
to prepare your data for training processes in a predictive and reproductible manner. Aligned with the paradigm of data as a service,
it offers a scalable and efficient means of managing semi-structured data, thereby expanding the toolkit of data services available
to organizations.

tutorials and find a full list of plugins and models.
