 
Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is determined from the succession of headings. However, for the Python documentation, this convention is used which you may want to follow :

# with overline, for parts
* with overline, for chapters
=, for sections
-, for subsections
^, for subsubsections
â€œ, for paragraphs
