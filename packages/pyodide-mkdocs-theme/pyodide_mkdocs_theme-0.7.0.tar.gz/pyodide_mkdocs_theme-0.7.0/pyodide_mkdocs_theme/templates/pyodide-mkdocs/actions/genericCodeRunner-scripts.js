/**Put in place code exclusions. Are handled:
 *   - builtin function calls
 *   - imports
 *   - method calls (done through a simple string check in the code, in runPythonCodeWithOptions)
 *
 *
 * ## RATIONALS:
 *
 * To forbid the use of some functions or packages, replace them in the global scope by "functions"
 * that look "more or less the same", but will raise an error when called, or when used in the
 * wrong way (imports).
 *
 *
 * ## PROBLEMS:
 *
 * 1. Pyodide itself uses various functions to run python code:
 *      - eval is used in pyodide.runPython
 *      - reversed and/or min and/or max may be used when building a stacktrace when an error is
 *        thrown in python
 * 2. This forbids to replace the __builtins__ versions of those functions (see about imports)
 * 3. but the __main__ script is run separately of pyodide actual "python runtime".
 *
 *
 * ## SOLUTION FOR BUILTINS FUNCTIONS:
 *
 * - Redeclare forbidden things in the global scope, through `globals()`, using an object that will
 *   systematically throw an ExclusionError when it's called.
 * - Since those are in the global scope, they are visible through `dir()`, so add some make up on
 *   those, using a class that redefines its __qualname__ and __repr__, so that it's less obvious
 *   they are the anti-cheats (it will still remain obvious for those who know enough, but if they
 *   can find about that, they probably could solve the problem the right way anyway).
 * - The (hidden) function `move_forward('builtin_name')` can be used in the tests to get back the
 *   original builtin. If used, it must be done inside a closure, so that the original builtin
 *   doesn't override the "Raiser" in the global scope (see below).
 * - Pyodide runtime won't see those globals, so it is not affected in any way. Only the user's or
 *   tester's codes are.
 * - Since the hacked version are available to the user in the global runtime, they could just
 *   delete them to get back the access to the original  __builtins__ version. To limit this risk,
 *   an extra check is done after the user's code has been run, verifying that the hacked function
 *    is still defined in the global scope, and that it's still the original Raiser instance.
 *
 *
 * ## SOLUTION FOR IMPORTS
 *
 * The main problem about `import` is that it actually go directly through `__builtins__`, using
 * `__import__`. So in that case, there is no other choice than hacking directly the __builtins__,
 * and then put it back in place when not useful anymore.
 *
 *
 * ## RECURSION LIMIT
 *
 * The sys module function is directly hacked, then put back in place: meaning, the function
 * setrecursionlimit is replaced at user's runtime with a Raiser object.
 *
