    @SANS:        String of spaces or coma separated python functions or modules/packages the
                  user cannot use. By default, nothing is forbidden.
                      - Every string section that matches a builtin callable forbid that function
                        by replacing it with another function which will raise an error if called
                      - Every string section prefixed with a fot forbids a method call. Here a
                        simple string containment check is done opn the user's code, to check it
                        does not contain the desired method name with the dot before it.
                      - Any other string section is considered as a module name and doing an
                        import (in any way/syntax) involving that name will raise an error.
    @MAX_SIZE:    Max number of lines of the IDE (default=30).
    @ID:          Optional. To use to differentiate two IDEs using the same python root file.
    @WHITE:       String of spaces or coma separated python modules/packages that have to be
                  preloaded before the code restrictions (@SANS) are applied.
    @LOGS:        If True, failing assertions without feedback during the private tests will
                  be augmented automatically with the code of the assertion itself. If None,
                  use the global `show_assertion_code_on_failed_test` plugin value, defined in
                  `mkdocs.yml`, to determine what to do (default=None).
    @REC_LIMIT:   Setup a specific recursion limit value for the runtime (-1 if not used)
    @TERM_H:      Number of lines to use for the terminal size (ignored for vertical terminals)
