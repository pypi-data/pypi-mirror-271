2024-05-05 12:55:39: Automation help:
2024-05-05 12:55:39: The following are standalone functions that can be called in an automation script, which should be its own .py file:
2024-05-05 12:55:39: - schedule_delay( delay='h:mm:ss' )
2024-05-05 12:55:39: - schedule_action( target_widget_nickname, target_field_name, new_field_value, confirm=True )
2024-05-05 12:55:39: - schedule_function( function )
2024-05-05 12:55:39: In schedule_action, on confirm=True the widget's confirm button is pressed after updating the field.
2024-05-05 12:55:39: Examples:
2024-05-05 12:55:39:  schedule_delay('0:00:10')
2024-05-05 12:55:39:  schedule_action( 'Argon MFC', 'Setpoint', '100', True)
2024-05-05 12:55:39: In schedule_function, you may pass a function that takes no arguments, or one that takes the dashboard object as an argument, e.g.:
2024-05-05 12:55:39:  schedule_function(lambda: print('Test'))
2024-05-05 12:55:39:  schedule_function(lambda dashboard: print(dashboard.widgets_by_nickname['Temp'].get_field('Temperature')))
2024-05-05 12:55:39: 
2024-05-05 12:55:39: The following are the nicknames of all available devices to control and their associated attributes you can write to:
2024-05-05 12:55:39: Nickname: Reactor TC -- Attributes: Temperature
2024-05-05 12:55:39: Nickname: Methane MFC -- Attributes: Gas Selection, Mode Selection, Setpoint Entry, Device Gas, Device Mode, Device Setpoint, Actual Flow
2024-05-05 12:55:39: Nickname: Argon MFC -- Attributes: Scale Factor Entry, Mode Selection, Setpoint Entry, Device Scale Factor, Device Mode, Device Setpoint, Actual Flow
2024-05-05 12:55:39: Nickname: Oxygen MFC -- Attributes: Scale Factor Entry, Mode Selection, Setpoint Entry, Device Scale Factor, Device Mode, Device Setpoint, Actual Flow
2024-05-05 12:55:39: Nickname: UV Light -- Attributes: Status Selection, Actual Status
2024-05-05 12:55:39: Nickname: Picarro -- Attributes: CH4 (ppm), CO2 (ppm), H2O (vol %)
2024-05-05 12:55:39: Nickname: GC FID -- Attributes: GC Logfile, Sensitivity, CH4 (ppm), CO2 (ppm)
