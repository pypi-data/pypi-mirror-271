## Missing:

- to_bigwig: needs a rewrite of the pyrle module

## Introduction

PyRanges is a Python library specifically designed for efficient and intuitive manipulation of genomics data,
particularly genomic intervals (like genes, genomic features, or reads).
The library is optimized for fast querying and manipulation of genomic annotations.

*"Finally ... This was what Python badly needed for years."* - Heng Li

## Documentation

The pyranges documentation, including installation instructions, API, tutorial, and how-to-pages, will soon become available.

## Features

  - fast
  - memory-efficient
  - featureful
  - pythonic/pandastic
  - supports chaining with a terse syntax
  - is a proper subclass of Pandas DataFrames

## Supporting pyranges

  - most importantly, cite pyranges if you use it. It is the main metric funding sources care about.
  - use pyranges in Stack Overflow/biostars questions and answers
  - star the repo (possibly important for github visibility and as a proxy for project popularity)

## Asking for help

If you encounter bugs, or the documentation is not enough a cannot accomplish a specific task of interest, or if you'd like new features implemented, open an Issue at github: https://github.com/pyranges/pyranges/issues
