The PyRanges documentation
==========================
PyRanges is a Python library specifically designed for efficient and intuitive manipulation of genomics data,
particularly genomic intervals (like genes, genomic features, or reads).
The library is optimized for fast querying and manipulation of genomic annotations.

Pyranges is open source, and hosted at github: https://github.com/pyranges/pyranges

Pyranges is developed by Endre Bakken Stovner and by
`Marco Mariotti's lab <https://www.mariottigenomicslab.com/>`_.
