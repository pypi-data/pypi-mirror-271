# pysypt

Python wrapper around [jasypt](http://www.jasypt.org/) for encrypting and decrypting strings using the BouncyCastle
Provider. The corresponding java code is located in `src/java/encryption-app`

## Usage

```python
from pysypt import StringEncryptor

algorithm = "PBEWITHSHA256AND256BITAES-CBC-BC"
key = "secret_key"
message = "my secret message"

enc = StringEncryptor(algorithm=algorithm, key=key)

encrypted = enc.encrypt(message)
print(encrypted)
# output
# pmwLKcnp8KP8jHDUf9r21Pbr8L/jQcKeOlcIrLosYSWpL6DhCY+APpSlPRwGl1EB

print(enc.decrypt(encrypted))
# output
# my secret message
```

## Build package from source

In the project root you can find `build_pypi_package.sh`, which takes care of first building the java app, then bundling
it together with the python code into a pypi package. The resulting package can be found in the `dist/` directory.

## Publish to PyPi using twine

When in a virtual python environment:

```shell
pip install build twine bumpver

bumpver update < --major | --minor | --patch >

./build_pypi_package.sh

twine check dist/*
twine upload dist/*
```
