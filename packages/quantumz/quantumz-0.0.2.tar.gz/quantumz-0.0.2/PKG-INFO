The QuantumZ package contains the set of functions to emulate quantum computations on the classical computers. The quantum states are supposed to be presented as dictionaries in the form {'|01>': 0.717, '|11>': 0.717} (for example). The same notation is used for the quantum gates.

All functions are described in the source code.
