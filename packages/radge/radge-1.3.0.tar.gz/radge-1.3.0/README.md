# Radge - Random algorithmic data generator

This simple library aims to facilitate creating testcases for and stress-testing solutions to algorithmic problems such as those found on Olympiads in Informatics, Codeforces, AtCoder, Leetcode and other sites.

## Current capabilities:
- Generating random graphs and DAGs (directed acyclic graphs)
- Generating various types of trees (random, binary, caterpillar and more)
- Generating prime numbers
- Generating sequences and permutations, with unique entries or not, sorted in any order
- Generating strings and their substrings
- Generating convex polygons

If you have any suggestions regarding any improvements or bug fixes, feel free to create an issue.
