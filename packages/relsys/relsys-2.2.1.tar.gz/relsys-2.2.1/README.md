# Description of RelSys

Consider a number of parallel queues where the capacity of the queue equals the number of servers. That is, queues where customers arrive according to a Poisson process and have exponentially distributed service-time. In the common M/M/c/c queue (also denoted the Erlang loss or Erlang-B system), a customer is rejected and lost from the system if all the servers are occupied upon arrival. In RelSys, we allow customers to be transferred with a probability to one of the other queues. If there is an idle server in the alternative queue, the customer is accepted and served with an exponentially distributed time with the same rate-parameter as the customer would have in the preferred queue. The figure below depicts an example featuring two queues where customers are relocated (i.e. transferred) with a probability to the other queue whenever the preferred queue is full. 

## Input parameters

RelSys uses five types of input parameters:

* An arrival rate vector, where each element corresponds to a customer type.
* A service time vector, where each element corresponds to a customer type.
* A relocation probability matrix. Rows correspond to customer types and columns to queues.  
* A capacity vector. Each element corresponds to a queue.
* A preferrence vector. Each element indicates the preferred queue of each customer type.

## Output types

RelSys has six output types:

* Occupancy *probability* distributions.
* Occupancy *frequency* distributions (only available if the system was evaluated using simulation).
* Shortage probabilities.
* Availability probabilities.
* Expected occupancy.
* Expected fraction of occupied capacity.

All outputs, except for the *expected occupancy* and *expected fraction of occupied capacity*, can be evaluated from two customer perspectives: The perspective of the customers preferring the queues, and the perspective of all customers arriving to the queues.    

# How to use

## Installation

Download and install `relsys` directly from PyPI.

```
pip install relsys
```

## Usage

Start by importing the module,

```python
import relsys
```

Now, specify the input parameters for the model. In this example, we consider a system containing 4 customer types and 4 queues.

```python
arrivalRates = [0.8,2.5,0.6,2.8]

serviceTimes = [10,5,10,8]

capacity = [15,20,10,30]

relocationProbabilities = [[0.0,0.4,0.1,0.5],
                           [0.3,0.0,0.5,0.0],
                           [0.0,0.5,0.0,0.5],
                           [0.2,0.3,0.5,0.0]]

preferredQueue = [0,1,2,3]
```

Create the model object and import the parameters,

```python
mdl = relsys.model(arrivalRates,serviceTimes,capacity,relocationProbabilities,preferredQueue)
```

The model can now be evaluated with `run`,

```python
mdl.run()
```

Return the resulting occupancy distributions with `getDensity` and shortage probabilities with `getShortageProb`,

```python
for queueIdx in range(4):
    print(mdl.getDensity(queueIdx))

for queueIdx in range(4):
    print(mdl.getShortageProb(queueIdx))
```

### The complete example

```python
#import the module
import relsys 

#arrival rates of each customer type
arrivalRates = [0.8,2.5,0.6,2.8]

#mean service time of each customer type
serviceTimes = [10,5,10,8]

#capacity of each queue
capacity = [15,20,10,30]

#fraction of rejected customers that are moved to an alternative queue node
#this is a number of customers x number of queues matrix
relocationProbabilities = [[0.0,0.4,0.1,0.5],
                           [0.3,0.0,0.5,0.0],
                           [0.0,0.5,0.0,0.5],
                           [0.2,0.3,0.5,0.0]]

#queue indices preferred by each customer type
preferredQueue = [0,1,2,3]

#create the model object and import the parameters
mdl = relsys.model(arrivalRates,serviceTimes,capacity,relocationProbabilities,preferredQueue)

#run the model
mdl.run()

#check the resulting occupancy distribution of each queue 
for queueIdx in range(4):
    print(mdl.getDensity(queueIdx))

#check the resulting shortage probabilities of each queue 
for queueIdx in range(4):
    print(mdl.getShortageProb(queueIdx))
```
