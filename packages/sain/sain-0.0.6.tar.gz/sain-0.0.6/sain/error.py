"""Interfaces for working with Errors.

This exposes one abstract interface, `Error` that other errors can implement and use as an argument to match upon.

Usually this error is returned from a `Result[T, Error]` object.

Those errors can be converted into `RuntimeError` exceptions by calling `sain.Err.unwrap` and `sain.Option.unwrap`.

For an example

```py
# Read the env variable, raises `RuntimeError` if it is not present.
path: Option[str] = Some(os.environ.get('SOME_PATH')).unwrap()
```
