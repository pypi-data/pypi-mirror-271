# SamGob

## Samon Goblin

### for all of the dice goblins in the world


samgob is a simple script for parsing the pydice programming language!

samgob is a small language designed to be run in a terminal environment and concisely roll dice.
The idea is to use consice syntax in order to describe complex rolls in simple ways.

as a taste a simple query to generate 100 characters by rolling 4 d 6 dropping the lowest value and re rolling
ones and twos can be run with the following instructions

-100S -6 s3T4D{2-6}

at a future date I should upate this page with more help specs for the language, but for now have this simple example :).
