# goblang

goblang is a simple context free grammer parser for python

an exmaple syntax file is provided in example.lang and use of the library can be seen
in the py file under the if __name__ == '__main__' section of the code.


## Disclaimer

it is SUPER jank :)

Please do not use this in a major project until I have time to update it.
Instead this code is provided as an example for how to or how NOT to design and solve this
particular problem.

The code is functional enough to be used if you take care in the context free grammers that you create,
but not general enough for arbitrary context free grammers.
