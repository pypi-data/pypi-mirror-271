# Overview
Single-cell multi-omics (scMulti-omics) technologies have revolutionized our understanding of cellular functions and interactions by enabling the simultaneous measurement of diverse cellular modalities. However, the inherent complexity, high-dimensionality, and heterogeneity of these datasets pose substantial challenges for integration and analysis across different modalities. To address these challenges, we develop a single-cell multi-omics deep learning model (scMDCF) based on contrastive learning, tailored for the efficient characterization and integration of scMulti-omics data. scMDCF features a cross-modality contrastive learning module that harmonizes data representations across different omics types, ensuring consistency while accommodating conditional entropy to preserve data heterogeneity. Furthermore, a cross-modality feature fusion module is designed to extract common low-dimensional latent representations of scMulti-omics data, effectively balancing the characteristics of these diverse omics data. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that scMDCF outperforms existing state-of-the-art scMulti-omics models across various types of scMulti-omics data. In particular, scMDCF exhibits progressive capability in extracting cell-type specific peak-gene associations and cis-regulatory elements from SNARE-seq data, as well as in elucidating immune regulation from CITE-seq data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the post-BNT162b2 mRNA SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination dataset, scMDCF successfully annotates specific vaccine-induced B cell subpopulations through integrative and multimodal analysis, uncovering dynamic interactions and regulatory mechanisms within the immune system after vaccination.
