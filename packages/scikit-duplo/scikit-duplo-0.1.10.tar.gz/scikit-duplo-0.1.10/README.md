# Contents

The sci-kit duplo package contains multiple classes that you can use in a sci-kit
learn compatible pipeline. There are ensemble learning classes within the `meta` subdirectory.
These classes expect you to pass in multiple other Sci-kit learn compatible 
machine learning classes. It will use these to build an ensemble of models to
predict the target variable.

There are feature engineering classes inside the `preprocessing` subdirectory. These are
ColumnTransformer compatible classes that expect to receive a dataframe and set of column
names that it will transform for the downstream pipeline processes.

LookupEncoder allows you to provide a custon dictionary of values for encoding categorical
variables.
