## Usage

In ScrapKit 2 We added a lot of new features such as `getMetaTags`, `getTextFromElement`, `getDataTables` and `getJsonData`

```python
import scrapKit as sk

# Extracting Meta Tags
meta_tags = sk.getMetaTags('https://example.com')
if meta_tags:
    print("Meta Tags:")
    for tag in meta_tags:
        print(tag)

# Extracting Text from Specific HTML Elements
paragraph_text = sk.getTextFromElement('https://example.com', 'p')
if paragraph_text:
    print("\nText from <p> elements:")
    print(paragraph_text)

# Extracting Data Tables
table_data = sk.getDataTables('https://example.com/data.html')
if table_data:
    print("\nData Tables:")
    for row in table_data:
        print(row)

# Extracting JSON Data
