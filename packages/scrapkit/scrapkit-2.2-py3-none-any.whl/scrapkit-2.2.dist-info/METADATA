# ScrapKit 2.2 - WebScrapping is now easy

## Usage

In ScrapKit 2.2 We added a Function from which Now you can scrape multiple pages of a website that you can print or save to any type of file. Also we added two more functions `cleanedText` and `getAttributeFromElements` 

## Syntax

```python
import scrapkit as sk

# Example URL
url = "https://en.wikipedia.org"

# Get attributes (example: get all 'src' attributes from 'img' tags)
image_src_attributes = sk.getAttributeFromElements(url, 'img', 'src')
sk.saveFile (image_src_attributes, filename = 'att.txt')
# OR
print (image_src_attributes)

# Scrape multiple pages
base_url = "https://pypi.org/"
num_pages = 3
all_links = sk.scrapeMultiplePages(base_url, num_pages)
sk.saveFile (all_links, filename = 'links.txt')
# OR
print (all_links)

# Clean text
dirty_text = "<p>Hello <b>world</b>!</p>"
cleaned_text = sk.cleanText(dirty_text)
sk.saveFile (f'cleaned text: {cleaned_text}', filename = 'cleaned.txt')
# OR
print (cleaned_text)
```
