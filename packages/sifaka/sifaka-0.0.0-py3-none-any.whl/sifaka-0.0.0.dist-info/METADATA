# Sifaka <!-- omit in toc -->

This aims to be a terminal-based application for testing your API endpoints.
Think `Postman` but in the terminal. I also want to add the ability to run
directly in the console, as an easier alternative to `curl` and similar.

Currently, it is in the very early stages of development and is not yet ready
for use.

## Development setup

Install the dependencies using Poetry:

```console
$ poetry install
```

Then, activate the virtual environment:

```console
$ poetry shell
```

The application can be run using the following command:

```console
$ sifaka
```
