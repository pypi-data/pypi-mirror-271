JupterLab/JupyerLite extension for Skills Network Authoring

If you are an author start [here](#to-use-the-extension-as-an-author)

If you are a contributor start [here](#to-contribute-to-the-extension)


## To use the extension as an author

### Install

To install the extension, execute:

```bash
pip install skillsnetwork-authoring-extension
```

After installing, enable the extension:

```bash
jupyter server extension enable skillsnetwork-authoring-extension
```

### Launch JupyterLab

To launch Jupyter Lab visit [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)

### Uninstall

To remove the extension, execute:

```bash
pip uninstall skillsnetwork-authoring-extension
```

### Edit a Lab via Token

## To Contribute to the Extension

### Before Getting Started

Check the JupyterLab version in staging and production and download the correct JupyterLab extension. 

To check the version go to [Menu Bar]([https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html#menu-bar]
) -> Help -> About JupyterLab

```
pip install jupyterlab==<version>
```

### Development install

Note: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Change directory to the skillsnetwork-authoring-extension directory
# Install package in development mode
pip install -e .
# Install jupyter-packaging
pip install jupyter-packaging
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
npm run build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
npm run watch
# Run JupyterLab in another terminal
jupyter lab
```

With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).

By default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:

```bash
jupyter lab build --minimize=False
```

### Launch JupyterLab

To launch Jupyter Lab visit [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)

### Development uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall skillsnetwork-authoring-extension
```

In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`
command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`
folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `skillsnetwork-authoring-extension` within that folder.

### Edit a Lab via Token

Demo [Here](#edit-a-lab-via-token)

#### Get a Token

1. Go to Author Workbench production [site](https://author.skills.network/)
2. Select `Labs` on the left panel screen
3. Select `JupyterLab` Tool Type
4. Open developer console
5. Search for `/hub/user` in `network` tab
6. Copy and paste `atlas-token` or `awb-token` from the `Request URL`

Example of `Request URL`:
```
Request URL:
https://jupyterlab-4-labs-prod-jupyterlab-us-east-0.labs.cognitiveclass.ai/hub/user/user-name/lab/?mode=author&env_type=jupyterlab&atlas_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdXRob3IiOnsdZGlzcGxheV9uYW1lIjoiT2xpdmVyIEx1byIsImVtYWlsIjoib2xpdmVyLmx1b0BpYm0uY29tIn0sImxhYl9pZCI6Ijg4ODciLCJwcm9qZWN0X2lkIjoiNTYwNSJ9.0p7v9qBIcnGyjWAovkoHEWxcCZHqcmRfqtV4PH7eb0U

# Package the python source package .tar.gz and binary package .whl
pip install build twine
python -m build
```
