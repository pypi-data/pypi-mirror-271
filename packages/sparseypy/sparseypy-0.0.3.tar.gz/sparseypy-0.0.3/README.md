# SparseyTestingSystem
A Python wrapper for the Sparsey Java implementation, with additional features such as result visualization, HPO, and more.


# Development notes
 

### CLI config validation
We have some in-built schemas for models, trainers, hpo runs.
	
Models:
	* Sparsey
	* ResNeT
	* ViT
	* ConvNeXT

Trainers:
	* ASParsey trainer
	* Any deep learning model trainer (most options are the same)

HPO runs:
	* Sparsey HPO runs (we need to cover all hyperparams)
	* ResNet HPO runs (most options are the same)
	* ViT HPO runs (most options are the same)
	* ConvNeXT HPO runs (most options are the same)

Use a config factory to create config schemas to valid the configs input by the user against.
For custom schemas -> users need to use --custom_schema <FILEPATH_TO_PICKLED_CUSTOM_SCHEMA> option in all the scripts or the -disable_config_validation flag.
