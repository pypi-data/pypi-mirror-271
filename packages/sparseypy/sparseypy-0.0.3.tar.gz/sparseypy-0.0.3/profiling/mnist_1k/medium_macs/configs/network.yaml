#     BE UPDATED WITH THE RESULTS OF TRAINING RUNS USING THIS NETWORK.YAML

#     width and height can be any positive integer values and do not need to be the same;

# layerwise configurations for each layer in the network
#     each entry in the list is a new layer, in order from the bottom of the model to the top
