# params for built-in datasets
params:
  # name: str - the name of the built-in dataset class to use
  #     this is NOT corrected or adjusted for capitalization so you 
  #     should use exactly the name from this page: 
  #     https://pytorch.org/vision/main/datasets.html
  name: MNIST
  # transform: str - the PyTorch transform required to convert the items 
  #     in this dataset from their native format to a PyTorch tensor 
  #     supported by the system. Unfortunately, this is required because
  #     each PyTorch dataset just returns items of its type and those aren't
  #     the same or predictable--MNIST returns PIL images, CIFAR-10 returns
  #     binary data, etc., and it's not possible to handle that without
  #     you telling us how to transform the data.
  #     IN THE CASE OF MNIST, the required transform is PILToTensor in order
  #     to convert the PIL images into tensors that we can use. OTHER DATASETS
  #     WILL REQUIRE DIFFERENT TRANSFORMS.
