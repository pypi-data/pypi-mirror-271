# preprocessing.yaml - system preprocessing configuration

transform_list:
# In this list, you can include custom transforms (located in core/transforms) 
# as well as the transforms PyTorch provides in torchvision.transforms.v2
# Transforms are applied in the order shown in the list from top (first) to bottom (last).

# Examples of custom transforms
# - name: binarize
#   params:
#     binarize_threshold: 0.5 # float, 0 < x < 1 
#

# all of the transforms below are examples of using the transform classes available in torchvision.transforms.v2
# for both PyTorch and system transforms, the class name should be typed in snake case
# name: string
  - name: resize
  # params: dict containing the parameters listed in the torchvision.transforms.v2 documentation for the given transform
    params:
      size: [12, 12]
      antialias: True

# convert images to float from uint8, and scale them to [0, 1]
  - name: to_dtype
    params:
      dtype: float32
      scale: True
      #probability: 0.5 # optional random application

# binarize
  # - name: grayscale
  #   params:
  #     num_output_channels: 1
  # - name: random_posterize
  #   params:
  #     p: 1.0
  #     bits: 1
  # - name: random_autocontrast
  #   params:
  #     p: 1.0
