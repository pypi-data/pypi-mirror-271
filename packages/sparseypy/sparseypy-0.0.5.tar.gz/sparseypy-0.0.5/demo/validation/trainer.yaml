#     whether to use a GPU to accelerate system performance, if one is available
#     (the system supports CUDA and MPS backends)
#     in general, you are better off leaving this out and letting the system
#     automatically use a GPU if it is available) unless you specifically want
#     to refuse to start the run in the absence of a GPU (set True) or
#     force the system to never use a GPU even if it is present (set False)
