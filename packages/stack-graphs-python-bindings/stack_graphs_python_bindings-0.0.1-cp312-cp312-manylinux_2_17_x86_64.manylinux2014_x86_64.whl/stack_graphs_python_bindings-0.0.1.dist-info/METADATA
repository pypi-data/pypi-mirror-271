# Stack-Graphs Python bindings

Opinionated Python bindings for the [tree-sitter-stack-graphs](https://github.com/github/stack-graphs) rust library.

It exposes very few, easy to use functions to index files and query references.

This is a proof of concept draft, to test scripting utilities using stack-graphs easily.

It uses pyo3 and maturin to generate the bindings.
