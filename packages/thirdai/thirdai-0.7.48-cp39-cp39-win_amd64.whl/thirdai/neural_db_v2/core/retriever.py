        Note on method signature:
        Choices are provided as a separate argument from queries. While it may
        be safer for the function to accept pairs of (query, choices), choices
        are likely the return value of some function fn(queries) -> choices.
        Thus, there likely exist separate collections for queries and
        choices in memory. This function signature preempts the need to reshape
        these existing data structures.
