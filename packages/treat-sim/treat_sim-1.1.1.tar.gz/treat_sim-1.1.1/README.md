# Towards Sharing Tools, and Artifacts, for Reusable Simulation: a minimal model example

## Overview

The materials and methods in this repository support work towards developing the S.T.A.R.S healthcare framework (**S**haring **T**ools and **A**rtifacts for **R**euable **S**imulations in healthcare).  The code and written materials here demonstrate the application of S.T.A.R.S' version 1 to sharing a `simpy` discrete-event simuilation model and associated research artifacts.  

* All artifacts in this repository are linked to study researchers via ORCIDs;
* Model code is made available under an MIT license;
* Python dependencies are managed through `conda`;`
* Documentation of the model is enhanced using a Jupyter notebook.
* The python code itself can be viewed and executed in Jupyter notebooks via [Binder](https://mybinder.org); 
* The materials are deposited and made citatable using Zenodo;
* The model is sharable with other researchers and the NHS without the need to install software.

## Instructions to run the model

### Online Notebooks via Binder

The python code for the model has been setup to run online in Jupyter notebooks via binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-treat-sim/HEAD)

> mybinder.org is a free tier service.  If it has not been used in a while Binder will need to re-containerise the code repository, and push to binderhub. This will take several minutes. After that the online environment will be quick to load.

### To download code and run locally

#### Downloading the code

Either clone the repository using git or click on the green "code" button and select "Download Zip".

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/stars-treat-sim
```

#### Installing dependencies

[![Python 3.9+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

All dependencies can be found in [`binder/environment.yml`]() and are pulled from conda-forge.  To run the code locally, we recommend install [mini-conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html); navigating your terminal (or cmd prompt) to the directory containing the repo and issuing the following command:

```
conda env create -f binder/environment.yml
```

Activate the conda environment using the following command

```
conda activate stars_treat_sim
```

#### Running the model

To run 50 multiple replications of across a number of example experiments use the following code


```python
from treat_sim.model import (get_scenarios, run_scenario_analysis,
                             scenario_summary_frame, 
                             DEFAULT_RESULTS_COLLECTION_PERIOD)

if __name__ == '__main__':

    results = run_scenario_analysis(get_scenarios(), 
                                    DEFAULT_RESULTS_COLLECTION_PERIOD,
                                    n_reps=50)

    results_summary = scenario_summary_frame(results)
    print(results_summary)

```

Alternative you can design and execute individual experiments by creating a `Scenario` object

```python
from treat_sim.model import Scenario, multiple_replications

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # use all default parameter values
    base_case = Scenario()

    results = multiple_replications(base_case).describe().round(2).T
    print(results)

```
