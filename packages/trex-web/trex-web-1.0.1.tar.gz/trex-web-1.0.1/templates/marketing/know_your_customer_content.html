	to provide more personalized products or services that meet their needs. 
	At the same time, it is also very important to maintain customer loyalty,

	Customer loyalty can have a significant impact on a company's success, 
	and when loyal customers spread positive word-of-mouth, 
	it can lead to a phenomenon known as customer loyalty fusion, 
	where the customer base multiplies as a result.
