## Typing stubs for beautifulsoup4

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`beautifulsoup4`](https://git.launchpad.net/beautifulsoup/tree) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`beautifulsoup4`.

This version of `types-beautifulsoup4` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `beautifulsoup4==4.12.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/beautifulsoup4. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `a3f7c2b235fb4d349b79ca9f1392d609f23be70e` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.0, pyright 1.1.361, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
