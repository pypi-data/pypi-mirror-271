Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 3 with the following meanings:
0 = represent that the passage has nothing to do with the query, 
1 = represents that the passage seems related to the query but does not answer it, 
2 = represents that the passage has some answer for the query, but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous information and 
3 = represents that the passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.

Following are some of the examples of relevance categorizations for different categories:

Assume that you are writing a report on the subject of the topic. If you would use any of the information contained in the passage in such a report, mark it 1. If the passage is primarily about the topic mark it 3, or contains vital information about the topic, mark it 2. Otherwise, mark it 0.

Query: {query}
Passage: {passage}

Split this problem into steps:
Consider the underlying intent of the search.
Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M).
Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).
Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O). Final score must be an integer value only.
Produce a JSON dictionary of scores without providing any reasoning.
