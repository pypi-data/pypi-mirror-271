# Image Difference Utility

## Description

This utility provides a simple way to compare two images (expected and actual screenshots) and generates a third image highlighting the differences with a purple overlay. It's designed to help quickly identify visual discrepancies in automated testing environments or for manual verification purposes.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

## Usage

To use the `ImageDifference` class in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the class from the `image_comparer.py` file.
2. Instantiate the class with paths to your expected and actual images.
3. Call the `generate_difference_image` method with the path where you want the difference image saved.

Example:

```cli
python image_diff/image_diff.py  --expectation 'path/to/expected_screenshot.png, --actual 'path/to/actual_screenshot.png', --output 'path/to/output_difference.png'
```

## Example

Below are examples of an expected screenshot, an actual screenshot, and the generated difference image output by the utility.
