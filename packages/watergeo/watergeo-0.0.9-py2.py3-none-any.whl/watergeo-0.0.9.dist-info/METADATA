## python package for water spatial analysis


-   Free software: MIT License
-   Documentation: (https://github.com/Andyzxm/watergeo)

    

## Here is a list of features that are included in this package (more to be included in the future):

- Interactive maps with basemap dropdown lists
- Data Visualization with vectors and rasters
- Folium adaptation for data visualization
- Google Earth Engine implementation for spatial analysis
- Split map 
- Time series
- Zonal statistics

## Introduction
- Background for water security on (Why watergeo and water study matters?)[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C65iqOSCZOY)
Watergeo is a demo Python package for interactive mapping and geospatial analysis. While it contains several spatial analysis techniques, it is specifically designed for water analysis and will implement more hydrological spatial analysis functions. It also utilizes the powerful Google Earth Engine and its data catalogs to further expand Watergeo package's utilities for users. Watergeo at the moment is based on two main open source packages such as Folium and Ipyleaflet, and is taking inspiration from Leafmap and Geemap to incorporate Earth Engine into the Watergeo package.
