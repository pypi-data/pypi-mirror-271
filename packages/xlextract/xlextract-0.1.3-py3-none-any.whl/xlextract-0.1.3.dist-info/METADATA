XLExtract
=========

An abstraction layer for quickly pulling data out of Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets.

The project is currently powered by the [openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/) library but you don't need to know anything about the underlying library and it could change in the future.

## Installation
xlextract can be installed via poetry with: ```poetry add xlextract```  
or via pip with: ```pip install xlextract```
